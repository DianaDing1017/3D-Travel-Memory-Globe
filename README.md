# 🌍 3D Travel Memory Globe

An interactive 3D web application for visualizing and recording travel memories on a rotating digital globe. Users can place "memory pins" at locations they've visited, upload photos, write reflections, and relive global experiences in an emotional and immersive way.

## 🧭 Project Proposal

### 🔍 Project Objectives

This project aims to build an **interactive 3D globe web application** where users can **record and relive their travel memories**. By placing multimedia-rich "memory pins" on a rotating Earth interface, the platform encourages storytelling through photos, text, and sounds tied to specific locations. It provides a more **emotional and artistic experience** than traditional route-focused travel maps.

### 🎯 Target Users and Their Needs

| User Type             | Needs                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Casual Travelers     | A beautiful and fun way to log and revisit personal travel moments.   |
| Visual Thinkers      | A globe-centric, visual-first storytelling medium.                        |
| Creatives            | Tools to present travel stories with images, text, and ambient sound.       |
| Private Users        | The ability to keep memories personal or selectively share them.            |

Unlike Google Earth or TravelMap, which focus on route exploration or satellite views, this project is about **emotional connection to place** — a personal globe of memories.

### 📦 Key Deliverables

- 🌍 A 3D interactive Earth (via **CesiumJS** or **Globe.gl**) with zoom/rotate capabilities.
- 📌 Memory pins: clickable points on the globe that store **user-generated content** (photos, descriptions, timestamps).
- 🔐 Simple user login system to support private and personal experiences.
- 🗂 Local or cloud-based file storage for user-uploaded media.
- 🧭 Optional timeline view to scroll through journeys chronologically.
- ✨ Clean, responsive UI design emphasizing emotional memory presentation.
- 🚀 Deployed version of the app (Heroku, Vercel, or Render).

---

### ⛓ Special Constraints

- **Rendering performance**: 3D graphics must be optimized for smooth interaction across devices.
- **File handling**: Uploading media requires size limits and secure processing (local or cloud).
- **User authentication**: Must be secure, even if simplified for demo purposes.
- **Scope control**: Avoid replicating full Google Earth functionality — focus on personal storytelling.

---

### 🌈 Expected Outcome

By the end of the 10-week timeline, the final deliverables will include:

- A functional 3D travel journal web app that supports:
  - User login/logout
  - Pinning locations on a 3D globe
  - Uploading and viewing multimedia content per location
- An artistic and intuitive user experience to explore travel memories emotionally.
- Well-documented source code hosted on GitHub with clean structure and modular design.
- Optional bonus features: AI-generated memory captions, music integration, private/public toggle.

This project is a creative fusion of geography, memory, and interaction — **a digital globe where emotions live**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JS, Globe.gl or CesiumJS  
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)  
- **Database**: SQLite or PostgreSQL  
- **Optional**: OpenAI API, Cloudinary/S3 for uploads

## 💻 Virtual Environment Setup (Windows)

This project uses a Python virtual environment for dependency management.

1. Ensure you have Python 3.9+ installed. You can verify with:

   ```powershell
   python --version
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment in your project directory:

   ```powershell
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the environment (Windows PowerShell):

   ```powershell
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   If you're using VS Code, the environment may auto-activate (you'll see `(venv)` in the terminal or a message in the corner).

4. Install dependencies:

   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Now you're ready to run the app.

## 📝 Client Feedback: 3D Earth Explorer

### ✅ Features Reviewed

- **Interactive 3D Globe**  
  Users can explore a 3D-rendered Earth with mouse interaction using `three.js` and `OrbitControls`.

- **City Search & Marker Placement**  
  Users can input city names to dynamically add new markers via backend API calls.

- **Location Detail Modal with Media Upload**  
  Clicking on a marker opens a modal showing the location name, coordinates, and an area to upload related media (images/videos).

---

### 🟩 Approved Features

- The 3D interaction and visual presentation are well-crafted and provide a smooth user experience.
- Modal design is clear, elegant, and effectively displays uploaded media.
- Zoom buttons and marker hover interactions add polish and usability.

---

### 🐞 Bugs Identified

- Users are currently unable to search for place names independently.
- The number of place names is not all large.

---

### 💡 Suggested Improvements

1. **Input Validation & Error UI**  
   Improve feedback when a city isn't found—e.g., highlight the input box or show a styled error message instead of just an alert.

2. **Increase the number of cities and improve the icon display**  
   When fetching or uploading files, consider adding a loading spinner to improve clarity and feedback.

---

### 📘 Reflection & Next Steps

- Developer has successfully implemented **3+ core features** and demonstrated good front-end architecture.


- **Suggested next focus areas**:
  - Improve the overall UI design and hope that the interface will be more interesting.
  - Fix mobile layout responsiveness and modal display edge cases.

Keep up the great work!
