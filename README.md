# 🌍 3D Travel Memory Globe

An interactive 3D web application for visualizing and recording travel memories on a rotating digital globe. Users can place “memory pins” at locations they've visited, upload photos, write reflections, and relive global experiences in an emotional and immersive way.

## 🧭 Project Proposal

### 🔍 Project Objectives

This project aims to build an **interactive 3D globe web application** where users can **record and relive their travel memories**. By placing multimedia-rich “memory pins” on a rotating Earth interface, the platform encourages storytelling through photos, text, and sounds tied to specific locations. It provides a more **emotional and artistic experience** than traditional route-focused travel maps.

### 🎯 Target Users and Their Needs

| User Type         | Needs                                                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Casual Travelers | A beautiful and fun way to log and revisit personal travel moments.  |
| Visual Thinkers  | A globe-centric, visual-first storytelling medium.                   |
| Creatives        | Tools to present travel stories with images, text, and ambient sound.|
| Private Users    | The ability to keep memories personal or selectively share them.     |

Unlike Google Earth or TravelMap, which focus on route exploration or satellite views, this project is about **emotional connection to place** — a personal globe of memories.
